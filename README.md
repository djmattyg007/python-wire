PySQLite
========

Python Wrapper for the standard sqlite3 API

PySQLite serves to simplify the process of creating and maintaining local databases.
It utilizes the built-in sqlite3 package, and does not require any external files.
Because of this, it is extremely lightweight.

Examples of use:

```python
import pysqlite

db = pysqlite.Database("test.db")

```
